            <p>I have been going to The Pet Fashion since it opened in town 3 years ago. I will not go to any other grooming place ever. My dog and my cat love coming here to get their shower, their nails, and all the services they get. I give the Pet Fashion 5 stars. -John-</p>

            <p>I bring my cat to The Pet Fashion to get groomed every month. I can trust the professionals that work here with leaving my cat here and coming back to pick him up at a later time without worry that something will happen to him. The proffesinal work, the friendly care they offer is the best. -Mary-
